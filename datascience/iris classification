  Iris is a flower . Iris classification is like a hello world programming for ML . Basically Iris has three types setosa,versicolor,verginica . versicolor and verginica has most of the properties in common. 
  Iris has two main parts: petal and sepal . both petal and sepal has length and width petal and sepal length and width are independent and class of the flower is dependent on these four attributes the accuracy keeps
  changing every time you run .
